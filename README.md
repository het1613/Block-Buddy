# Introduction
A Chrome Extension to boost productivity by blocking social media sites during study/work hours. Users have the option to select/deselect which websites they choose to block. They also have the ability to turn off the blocker, keep it always on or follow an automatic schedule (aka the user's study/working hours).

# Inspiration
Often times while I'm studying, I procastinate and wander off to social media sites such as Instagram, Netflix and YouTube. To increase productivy and stop me from procastinating, I wanted to create an app that would block me from going to such sites during certain hours. As such, I decided to create my own Chrome Extension that would solve my problem. 

# Technology
The extension uses a JavaScript backend alongside Chrome Storage Sync API to save user preferences across all devices. It also utilizes a frontend developed using HTML, CSS and JS. 

# Usage
I am in the process of publishing this extension onto the Chrome Web Store. Until then, to use the extension:
- Git clone this repo onto your computer
- Go to "Manage Extensions" tab on Google Chrome
- Turn on developer mode and click "Load Unpacked"
- Upload the project file and enjoy!
